Attached is the research paper for my semester-long group project from my Biological Clocks class in Fall 2024. 
All data and code lies in a Jupyter Notebook within a Duke container that runs on Duke Linux machines.
Unfortunately, the SSH key we had created for this container is expired, and at this moment I cannot get back into the container
to retrieve the code. I am looking to fix this soon. 

Also, it should be noted that the part I contributed to most was identifying parallels between N. crassa and O. kimflemingiae 
clock networks, as well as repeatedly running the Local Edge Machine (LEM) to identify regulatory patterns.
